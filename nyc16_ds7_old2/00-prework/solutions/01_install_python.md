Did you install Python 2 or 3? Why? How can you check the version of Python installed if you happen to be on an unfamiliar computer?

> I am using Python version 2.7 since not all libraries have been migrated to version 3. Also I learned python using python 2.7 so I'm more familiar with Python 2.7 syntax and behaviors

> Sometimes I use Python version 3.5 for Django, etc.  

To see what version of python is running:

>
```
$ python -V
$ python --version
```
