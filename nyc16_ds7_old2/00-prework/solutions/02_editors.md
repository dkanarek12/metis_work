What terminal editor will you use? How did you make your decision?

>>  I use Emacs since that's the first editor I used at school and my job.

What graphical editor will you use? How did you make your decision? What are some interesting features of your editor? What are some useful keyboard shortcuts for your editor? How do you customize your editor?


>> I will use Emacs since:

* I can use for both terminal and graphical.
* It's the first editor I learned.  
* It's well known.
* It's a good way to impress programmers.
* Keyboard shortcuts:
  * ctrl k           deletes line
  * esc shift <      go to top of file
  * esc shift >      go to end of file
  * ctrl x, ctrl s   save file
  * ctrl v           scroll down
  * ctrl a           go to beginning of line
  * ctrl e           go to end of line
  * ctrl p           go up one line
  * ctrl n           go down one line
  * ctrl b           go backwards one character
  * ctrl f           go forward one character

* Customization - I adjusted the colors.
