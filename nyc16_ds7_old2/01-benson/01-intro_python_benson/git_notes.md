###Git and GitHub

####Reference Files for Git
 * In your favorite browser:  create a bookmark folder called "metis" and bookmark the following:  
https://github.com/thisismetis/nyc16_ds7  
 * Also, under the "metis" folder, bookmark the git notes:  
https://github.com/reshama/resource-links/tree/master/git  

 * Once you fork the repo, you will also want to book mark that.  Here's an example of my bookmark:

####Spectacle App (for Mac)  
Spectacle makes use of several keyboard shortcuts that trigger specific window actions. A window action is nothing more than a command that tells Spectacle how to change the size and/or position of a particular window.
 * Move and resize windows with ease
 * Window control with simple and customizable keyboard shortcuts
