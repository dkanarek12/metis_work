#### Pair Problem

We do not have a new problem for the day.

But we covered a lot of stuff over the week. Take sometime to review the past challenges, the solutions and optimizations as pairs. I've posted my solutions and notes for each of them.

If one of you feel more comfortable than the other, please be the guide and sounding-board for your partner. It helps to think things through and review.
