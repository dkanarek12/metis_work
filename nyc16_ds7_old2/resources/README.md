Python - some good skills to add to toolbox:

a.  Review the python functions that read in multiple files

b.  [Explore 'defaultdict' option in python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5900578/how-does-collections-defaultdict-work)
defaultdict means that if an key is not found in the dictionary that instead of a KeyError being thrown a new value is created. The type of this new pair is given by the argument of defaultdict.

c.  [Explore pprint in python](https://pymotw.com/2/pprint/)
