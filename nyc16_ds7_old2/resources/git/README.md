##Git and GitHub

####Bookmark these:  Reference Files for Git
 * In your favorite browser:  create a bookmark folder called "metis" and bookmark the following:  
https://github.com/thisismetis/nyc16_ds7  
 * Also, under the "metis" folder, bookmark the git notes:  
https://github.com/reshama/resource-links/tree/master/git  
 * Once you fork the repo, you will also want to book mark that.  Here's an example of my bookmark:  
https://github.com/reshama/nyc16_ds7
