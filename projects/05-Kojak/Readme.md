My final project for the Metis Data Science Bootcamp can be found in Acceleromter_Based_Gesture_Recognition.ipynb  
For this project I collected data from the accelerometer sensor on my Android phone while performing different gestures
and processed this data so that I could train a machine learn model to accuractely identify which gesture was being performed 
based on the signal.
